Years do odd things to identity.
What does it mean to say
I am that child in the photograph
at Kishamish in 1935?
Might as well say I am the shadow
of a leaf of the acacia tree
felled seventy years ago
moving on the page the child reads.
Might as well say I am the words she read
or the words I wrote in other years,
flicker of shade and sunlight
as the wind moves through the leaves.
AUTUMN
gold of amber
red of ember
brown of umber
all September
MCCOY CREEK
Over the bright shallows
now no flights of swallows.
Leaves of the sheltering willow
dangle thin and yellow.
OCTOBER
At four in the morning the west wind
moved in the leaves of the beech tree
with a long rush and patter of water,
first wave of the dark tide coming in.
SOLSTICE
On the longest night of all the year
in the forests up the hill,
the little owl spoke soft and clear
to bid the night be longer still.
THE WINDS OF MAY
are soft and restless
in their leafy garments
that rustle and sway
making every moment movement.
HAIL
The dogwood cowered under the thunder
and the lilacs burned like light itself
against the storm-black sky until the hail
whitened the grass with petals.
Mother rain, manifold, measureless,
falling on fallow, on field and forest,
on house-roof, low hovel, high tower,
downwelling waters all-washing, wider
than cities, softer than sisterhood, vaster
than countrysides, calming, recalling:
return to us, teaching our troubled
souls in your ceaseless descent
to fall, to be fellow, to feel to the root,
to sink in, to heal, to sweeten the sea.
When I used to see bats flying
in the California twilight
their intricate zigzag voices
went flickering with them
but they fell silent with the years
and without that tiny sonar static
to see them flicker
in and out of being
is a kind of blindness
In the twilight in my dream
a little bat was flying
and awakening I wondered
if the bat that I remembered
flying in the twilight
of the dream of California
was in California or the dream.
I am such a long way from my ancestors now
in my extreme old age that I feel more one of them
than their descendant. Time comes round
in a bodily way I do not understand. Age undoes itself
and plays the Ouroboros. I the only daughter
have always been one of the tiny grandmothers,
laughing at everything, uncomprehending,
incomprehensible.
Remember me before I was a heap of salt,
the laughing child who seldom did
as she was told or came when she was called,
the merry girl who became Lot’s bride,
the happy woman who loved her wicked city.
Do not remember me with pity.
I saw you plodding on ahead
into the desert of your pitiless faith.
Those springs are dry, that earth is dead.
I looked back, not forward, into death.
Forgiving rains dissolve me, and I come
still disobedient, still happy, home.
In the vast abyss before time, self
is not, and soul commingles
with mist, and rock, and light. In time,
soul brings the misty self to be.
Then slow time hardens self to stone
while ever lightening the soul,
till soul can loose its hold of self
and both are free and can return
to vastness and dissolve in light,
the long light after time.
Long after sunset the afterlight
glows warm along the rimrock.
A wind down off the mountain
blows soft, a little chill.
I’ve come to love the quiet sound
cattle make cropping short grass.
Day and night are much the same
to them in the pastures of summer,
cows and calves, they crop and pull
with that steady, comfortable sound
as the light in the rimrock and the sky
dims away slowly. Now no wind.
I don’t know if cattle see the stars,
but all night long they graze
and walk and stand in the calm
light that has no shadows.
Very slowly burning, the big forest tree
stands in the slight hollow of the snow
melted around it by the mild, long
heat of its being and its will to be
root, trunk, branch, leaf, and know
earth dark, sun light, wind touch, bird song.
Rootless and restless and warmblooded, we
blaze in the flare that blinds us to that slow,
tall, fraternal fire of life as strong
now as in the seedling two centuries ago.
As the number of the year gets bigger
the year itself grows smaller
but heavier. It acquires gravity.
It will finally get so heavy
that it cannot continue as it is
but implodes to a black hole
into which sink all the years
becoming numberless
and utterly weightless.
What is the way to yesterday?
A long way back and a little way forth
And a thousand miles to the North
In a plane, in a train, in Charley’s Wain.
And when you get back it’s tomorrow again.
Time says “Let there be”
every moment and instantly
there is space and the radiance
of each bright galaxy.
And eyes beholding radiance.
And the gnats’ flickering dance.
And the seas’ expanse.
And death, and chance.
Time makes room
for going and coming home
and in time’s womb
begins all ending.
Time is being and being
time, it is all one thing,
the shining, the seeing,
the dark abounding.
Somewhere I read 
that when they finally staggered off the mountain 
into some strange town, past drunk, 
hoarse, half naked, blear-eyed, 
blood dried under broken nails 
and across young thighs, 
but still jeering and joking, still trying 
to dance, lurching and yelling, but falling 
dead asleep by the market stalls, 
sprawled helpless, flat out, then 
middle-aged women, 
respectable housewives, 
would come and stand nightlong in the agora 
silent 
together 
as ewes and cows in the night fields, 
guarding, watching them 
as their mothers 
watched over them. 
And no man 
dared 
that fierce decorum.
Beware when you honor an artist.
You are praising danger.
You are holding out your hand
to the dead and the unborn.
You are counting on what cannot be counted.
The poet’s measures serve anarchic joy.
The story-teller tells one story: freedom.
Above all beware of honoring women artists.
For the housewife will fill the house with lions
and in with the grandmother
come bears, wild horses, great horned owls, coyotes.
When the great lordly singers hush,
my casual and selfless voice
that takes no profit, makes no choice,
pipes up, indifferent as a thrush.
When brazen monuments corrode
and praise is dust in dust with blame
and dateless night hides every name,
I still go lilting down the road.
It’s sad that hopes and poets die,
but my dear task and fondest care
is to bear softly what’s to bear
and ever to sing the lullabye.
Who could have for some reason
put a large grey stone
way up in a cottonwood?
Not even on a branch: a twig
holds up that feather boulder
softer than the evening air.
Another deeper in the leaves
turns its silent horns this way,
gazes, shifts the grip
of the mousedeath talons,
and softly tells us who.
Indignant indolence.
Wrath gone all downy.
An awful gold round glare
shut halfway to pure contempt.
Birdwatchers.
Someone should remove them.
If they were smaller
If it were evening
I would see to it.
And presently
issue a pellet containing their bones.
Moon cursive
shell curve
of wings in leaves and shadows
soundless, halfseen.
An owl is mostly air.
Where on this wild hill alone
a child watched the evening star,
let these bits of ash and bone
rejoin the earth they always were,
the earth that let her sing her love,
the gift that made the giver
here on the lonely hill above
the valley of the river.
A willingness to die is my desire,
not of the mind alone
but of the weary heart and weakened bone.
My fear is that the body, always wanting more,
will clutch at flames of fire
sooner than leave me free to go
on through the open door.
Sky gloom and gleam.
Road rain-glaze glare.
Infinite light glitters
in fern-fronds, fir-needles,
flashes from great gold maples.
The local crow
patrols the road.
The local crow
knows.
And discloses,
reports, remarks,
speaks freely.
Though no doubt keeping
certain dark
secrets.
As the old oaks
are swift and shy
in their delicate flower,
so the reticent nobility
of the bronze oak autumn
lasts only briefly.
But the short-lived, long-leaved,
roadside willows will not
be hurried into gold,
and hold their green intention
to leaf out long before April.
The next rain crouches
in the yoke of the hills
dark-grey puma
with a misty tail
lashing the silent
trees of the forest.
The salt in the small bowl looks up at me
with all its glittering eyes and says:
I am the dry sea.
Your blood tastes of me.
Why is it I want to cry?
Crow, crow, tell me.
There is a shadow passing by.
The willows call me.
Why would an old woman weep?
Willow, tell me, willow.
Crows went flying through my sleep.
I cry and follow.
Watch where the branches of the willows bend
See where the waters of the rivers tend
Graves in the rock, cradles in the sand
Every land is the holy land
Here was the battle to the bitter end
Here’s where the enemy killed the friend
Blood on the rock, tears on the sand
Every land is the holy land
Willow by the water bending in the wind
Bent till it’s broken and it will not stand
Listen to the word the messengers send
Life like the broken rock, death like the sand
Every land is the holy land
I wrote a poem called The Local Crow
the poem got lost long ago
so did the crow
still sometimes
the black wings come across my mind
the words I cannot find
Snow halfseen in the rain
on a dark east wind.
A crow flies the hard way.
Winter is my mind.
Gusts of smoke, ghosts of snow
through the old trees
blow on the crow’s wind
to a cold sea.
They came in their usual black
unusually silent, sat
on one branch or another,
shifting about, uneasy,
as if the funeral was late.
Dead ivy smothered
their ruinous chapel.
One by one they took flight
heavy, reluctant.
Crow on the broken tree, cawing.
Nobody answers. A meaningless
mineral noise from the ocean
crashing and hissing, half rhymic, unceasing.
But not the characteristic indignant
croak, or the rattle they make when they’re courting.
Anthracite-shining, solid of body,
firm on the ground, heavy aloft.
Sociable creatures, gossipy. Excellent parents.
Crows do not migrate. Crows hang around.
We brought the virus, we tourists, highflyers,
over from Egypt, over the oceans
crashing and hissing the way they were doing
ages before anyone cawed, anyone courted,
anyone heard, and the way they’ll be doing
after we’ve all gone back into silence
and nobody answers. Never a word.
Crows are the color of anarchy
and close up they’re a little scary.
An eye as bright as anything.
Having a pet crow would be
like having Voltaire on a string.
Crows continually going and coming
call to other crows, caw, cark, talk,
and flit like heavy fragments of cast iron, black,
thrown from this tree to that,
and in that tree or this sit throned
like black, heavy fragments of cast iron, talk,
cark, call, caw to other crows that flit
and sit in a continual coming and going of crows.
The wood thrush, it is! Now I know
who sings that clear arpeggio,
three far notes weaving
into the evening
among leaves
and shadow;
or at dawn in the woods, I’ve heard
the sweet ascending triple word
echoing over
the silent river—
but never
seen the bird.
Crows are the color of anarchy
and close up they’re a little scary.
An eye as bright as anything.
Having a pet crow would be
like having Voltaire on a string.
